## Rules
- Make sure your code is clean and organized
- Always have if statements opened and closed. For example something like this
```js
if (true) {
  // ...
  return;
}
```
and not
```js
if (true) return;
```
- Don't use borders unless they look good on the user interface
- Community Guidelines still apply for you no matter what :)
- Sabotaging code could get you in unavoidable trouble
- Don't use any kind of Mozilla libraries or gaia elements. Or your code will be too unstable or break every time Mozilla changes something without bothering about people's existing code. I repeat. Don't!
- Feel free to use orchid assets as long as it's not for a intentionally harmful product
- Only use the default theme variables and use them correctly by their names (e.g. --button-background for buttons)
- Don't make up dumb unrelated problems and ask me to fix them. I swear to god i will end you.
- Never open your code like this. This is JS and not Java
```js
function myFunction(arg)
{
  // ...
}
```
the right way is this one
```js
function myFunction(arg) {
  // ...
}
```
